# Creating-a-Resource-Group-in-Microsoft-Azure

Hello everyone!

Today we will create a simple Resource Group within Microsoft Azure.

FIRST SECTION: Create Resource Group

First, we will locate the Resource Group icon by typing in "resource group" into the azure searchbar (the icon will look like a light blue cube), and clicking it.

This will open up the resource group section, here we will click on "create" to get things started.

Our next step is to come up with the name of the resource group, you can type in whatever you desire. For this project, we will simply type in something along the lines of "rg-new" to keep things relevant.
You can choose whichever region you like, I prefer East US because it is usually the most available. After this, click "review + create".

When validation has passed, it just confirms that our resource group is ready to be created. Let's go ahead and click the "create" button below.
